# C++


C++ is a high-performance, general-purpose programming language that is widely used for system/software development and game programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 at Bell Labs as an extension of the C programming language.















## Key Features of C++ 















- **Object-Oriented**: C++ supports object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.







- **Low-Level Manipulation**: C++ allows low-level memory manipulation, which makes it suitable for developing system software and applications requiring direct hardware access.







- **Portability**: C++ programs can be compiled and run on different platforms with minimal modification.







- **Performance**: C++ is known for its high performance due to its close relationship with machine code and minimal runtime overhead.















## Syntax















C++ syntax is similar to that of C, with added features such as classes and objects. Here's an example of a simple C++ program:















```cpp







#include <iostream>







using namespace std;















int main() {







    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;







    return 0;







}
